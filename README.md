# JJazzDBMVC

This is a Model-View-Controller C# & HTML/CSS web app that I made for a class that demonstrates SQL CRUD (Create, Read, Edit, & Delete) functionality.
It won't do anything without the connection string pointing to an actual SQL database.
I had it deployed on Azure for a while but I ran out of credits very quickly and so I had to take it offline.
I may decide to upload the SQL files in their own folder.
